/// Visual C++ does not follow the Common Vendor ABI, so the results of the
/// paper don't necessarily apply to their implementation. The library relies
/// on the following two properties, which are true about implementation 
/// following the Common Vendor API:
///  1. v-table pointer is located at offset 0 of the object
///  2. v-table pointers uniquely represent subobjects
/// Both of these properties are violated in case of G as implemented by the
/// Visual C++ (10 and 11 at least). We can see that B part of G is laid out
/// after non-polymorphic F, making its v-table pointer not be at offset 0 
/// relatively to G. Besides, the v-table pointer at offset 0 of B is not unique
/// as it is shared by G1, G2 and G3.
///
/// Mach7 calls a dedicated function vtbl_of(const void*), which can be 
/// overloaded by the user for a given sub-hierarchy to resolve both issues.
/// 
/// The overloaded function has to be declared in the library's namespace as
/// we did not want to polute the global namespace. Note that it simply forwards
/// the call to a base class, that does have v-table pointer at offset 0. Most
/// importantly note that we did not forward the call to the B base of G, that 
/// also has a v-table pointer at offset 0, but to its virtual base A. We did
/// this because B's v-table pointer does not uniquely identify subobject, while
/// A's does.
